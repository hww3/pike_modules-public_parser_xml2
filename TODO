handle element definition properly; we need to do something with 
xmlElementContentPtr...

handle character encoding for inputs that aren't 8 bits wide (only SAX 
still needs to be done).

we need something similar to HTML.Parser...

we need to support html mode parsing in SAX

Node resulting from XMLReader.expand() does not get destroyed after 
next read(). This could cause real problems.
